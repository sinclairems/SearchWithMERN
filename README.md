# SearchWithMERN
A book search engine built with MERN.

## The Task

This week, I took starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.

  ## Future Development
In the future, I will remove all the bugs and get this app to work as intended. I will also add more features to the app to make it more user-friendly.
